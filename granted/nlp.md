## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
- Improve the awareness of natural language processing issues in current eScience projects by increasing the communication between knowledgeable and interested engineers
- Share knowledge about and experiences with NLP. This will create a better chance of solving bottlenecks in these projects thanks to feedback of our team
- Enhance the understanding of recent natural language processing techniques among eScience engineers by presentations/courses of recent developments in the field
