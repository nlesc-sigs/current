## Plans for the coming year
<!--  help text goes here  -->
- **Finish course Deep Learning for NLP**: we have one [https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoROMvodv4rOhcuXMZkNm7j3fVwBBY42z](video lecture) left and might want to add one or two hands-on sessions
- **Continue general meetings**: in which we discuss the progress of the running NLeSC NLP projects

## What are the expected outputs of the proposed SIG?
- Improved awareness of natural language processing issues in current eScience projects by increased communication between knowledgeable and interested engineers
- Better chance of solving bottlenecks in these projects thanks to feedback of our team
- Enhanced understanding of recent natural language processing techniques among eScience engineers by presentations/courses of recent developments in the field
