# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG?
Analytics

## Which two persons will act as SIG Leads?
<!--  Please make sure to have two SIG leads to reduce bus factor.
      SIG leads are allowed to write the hours dedicated to organizing
      SIG activities under the R&D budget. Please mention in the notes the
      name of your SIG:
        Account: 000104
        Project: 020203
        Hour type: 00071
        Notes: Hours for X SIG
       -->
- Flavio Hafner (current)
- Johan Hidding

We rotate the leadership, and the current lead is indicated with `(current)`. 

## What is SIGâ€™s mission?
<!--  help text goes here  -->
The mission of this SIG in the broadest sense, is to raise general knowledge on applied analytical and numerical solutions in the Netherlands eScience Center, as well as their technical implementations. 
We aim for a deeper understanding than is generally needed to use a specific method, that is, to go beyond the black-box level of thinking. Mathematics/statistics is capable of drastically reducing the complexity of existing solutions in a wide variety of cases, as well as formulating novel ideas that lie outside our comfort zone.


## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?
<!--  Please transfer your SIG existing repo to this GitHub organization  -->
<https://github.com/NLeSC/Analytics-SIG>

## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?
analytics@esciencecenter.nl

## Plans for 2024

Our interest lies in the following themes:
- statistical computing for social sciences 
- causal inference and machine learning 
- recent developments in techniques for data sharing through federated learning and differential privacy 
- understanding deep learning algorithms and backpropagation
- simulation modeling of the socio-economic aspects of climate change

For some of these topics, we will collaborate with the Machine Learning SIG.

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?
- Internal training on a specific topic (mentioned above)
- Sharing knowledge on statistics (at basic/intermediate level)
- Transfer of knowledge by inviting external speakers
- Keeping a portfolio of expertise in analytics at the center
- Making a collection of tools and resources
