# Application form for starting/continuing a SIG

## What is/will be the name of the SIG?

Quantum Computing SIG

## Which person will act as SIG Lead?

Carlos M. R. Rocha (c.rocha@esciencecenter.nl)
<!--- Pranav Chandramouli (p.chandramouli@esciencecenter.nl) -->

## What is SIGâ€™s mission?

The SIG aims to:
- develop and nurture expertise in the field of quantum computing within the center. 
- Keep up to date with advancements in the field.
- Provide a stage to discuss projects/ideas related to quantum computing.

## What is the GitHub repository of the SIG use?

https://github.com/nlesc-sigs/QC-SIG

## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?

- Outlook address: qcsig@esciencecenter.nl
- Team channel: [link](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3as0UoUSL0pPATSO1TQQIAlzix6tHciSgdvgU1ycKx6HQ1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=787697c8-1a3a-4c07-9db4-6b131aa280cc&tenantId=aa3aeacc-6307-42b2-ac05-787dd5c32574)

## SIG outcomes of the past year (for existing SIGs)

All sections of the past year aimed at providing an overview of the most fundamental aspects of quantum computing. We presented and discussed together the basics of:
- qubits, quantum gates, quantum circuits, and quantum entanglement
- fundamental quantum phenomena like quantum parallelism, quantum teleportation and superdense coding
- quantum hardware and noisy gates

In addition to basic theory discussions, we have also: 
- organized hands-on coding sections
- provided an overview of a few ongoing QC projects within the center, *e.g.*, [QCforQC](https://research-software-directory.org/projects/qcforqc)
- invited one external speaker, Amira Abbas from QuSoft, to talk about quantum machine learning

## Plans for the coming year
<!--  help text goes here  -->
The SIG will have one session every four weeks according to SIG slot 10, starting in March 2023. The following types of sessions are currently being planned:

- **Learn together**: Participants will learn quantum computing together based on curated materials. Based on availability, access to real quantum hardware could be arranged for the participants to explore.
- **Seminars**: Speakers, internal and external, will be invited to present materials related to quantum computing focusing on recent advances and breakthroughs in the field
- **Discussion**: Participants can discuss specific topics and/or projects (ongoing and proposed) with each other aimed at sharing knowledge and ideas in quantum computing.

Our link with quantum application lab will help in identifying and inviting external speakers in the field.

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?

- Increased expertise in the center for quantum computing.
- Increased visibility of the center's interest/expertise in quantum computing 
- Knowledge transfer from external participants to the center
