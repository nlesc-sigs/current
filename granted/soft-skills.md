## What is the Office group that the SIG uses?
<!--  help text goes here  -->
Soft-Skill SIG [channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3ab6082594f90a4f7d9b9b4521f5b7eb91%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=c373a0f6-88c9-47d6-b318-cd998d7efa51&tenantId=aa3aeacc-6307-42b2-ac05-787dd5c32574).

## SIG outcomes of the past year (for existing SIGs)
<!--  As a simple list of activities in this period is enough.  -->
* We have provided a place where participants feel comfortable to share knowledge and experiences related to Soft-Skills (our main target).
* We have discussed various topics related to mental health. This has been a very important topic for many employees in the light of the corona lock-downs and the increased working from home that remained.
* We have started drafting official best-practice guidelines for hosting hybrid meetings.


## Plans for the coming year
<!--  help text goes here  -->
We have received feedback as a result of a feedback session we organized at the end of 2022. This feedback is guiding our plans for coming year:

- **Remain the safe space for soft skills**: The Soft Skills SIG is for many people the place to talk about how to deal with the more personal/emotional issues, share experiences and get feedback in a safe environment. Our main goal is to remain that safe environment that so many people value.
- **Hybrid meetings document**: Finalize the hybrid meetings document to become the official eScience Center guidelines on hosting hybrid meetings. If suited, the document can be converted to a blogpost for sharing externally.
- **Series of meetings about feedback**: By popular demand, we will cover the topic of giving and receiving feedback in a series of 2 or 3 meetings. The series will at least contain a general session about feedback (similar to our session in 2021) and a session specific to feedback in the work we do. Potentially this second topic is split into digital feedback (code reviews, pull requests, comments in documents, etc.) and live feedback (in teams, at presentations, to project partners, etc.).
- **Balance and variety in meetings**: Last year we identified three meeting formats that fit well for the soft skills SIG: (1) Open discussion on a particular topic, often preceded by a short "own experience" presentation by a member of the SIG, (2) Hour filling talks by invited (external) speaker about specific topic, (3) Hands-on session to develop materials or practice specific skills. We want to find a good balance over the year between the various meeting formats and covering a wide reange of topics (topics are collected and organized in the [SIG github repository](https://github.com/NLeSC/Soft-Skills-SIG/projects/1)) 
- **Relation to the HR Soft Skills program**: With the initialization of the HR Soft Skills program last year, including trainings in various soft skills topics, the Soft Skills SIG had to reconsider their role and value in the eScience Center. We found however that the two are complementary, where the Soft Skills SIG still takes the role of the highly valued safe space where members can discuss sensitive topics in high confidence, do hands-on work and discuss more advanced/specialized topics that do not fit in the HR program. The HR program in turn has budget and can demand from employees to follow specific basic trainings. In the coming year the Soft Skills SIG will aim to take an advisory role for the HR program and give feedback on previous trainings and suggestions for future trainings. 

## What are the expected outputs of the SIG?
<!--  Think of internal as well as external dissemination targets -->
- Hybrid meetings best practices (internal document and blog post)
- Suggestions for HR training program
- Guide on giving and receiving eScience related feedback (blogpost and/or internal document)
- Slide decks about various topics
